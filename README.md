Posting imports for my profiles for certain plugins.

Will update whenever possible and try and sort stuff out as new patches come.

I've opened up a ko-fi incase people wish to support the work I put into the UI/CDs. Tips/donations are completely optional and I will be eternally grateful no matter what. Aslong as people are happy with the UI, then I'll continue to work on it and post updates so that people can continue using it!!
